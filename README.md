# UNMIX: Identifying Hidden Buyers in Darknet Markets via Dirichlet Hawkes Process
Recognize the exact hidden buyers in the Darknet


## Running Environment

```
Python 3.7.3
```

## DateSet

We evaluate **Unmix** on two kinds of datasets: several *Darknet* datasets (Dream  Market,Wall  StreetMarket, and Empire Marke) and one [*name disambiguation* dataset](https://www.aminer.cn/billboard/whoiswho).

## Model Evaluation

1. Download the *name disambiguation* data files, 'cna_valid_author_ground_truth.json', 'cna_valid_unass_competition.json', 'cna_valid_pub.json' and 'whole_author_profile.json' into the folder [raw_data/](https://github.com/PanpanZheng/UNMIX/tree/master/dblp/raw_data).

2. Run the model by the following command

```
    python unmix.py
```
