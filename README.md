# DMHP: Using Dirichlet Marked Hawkes Processes for Insider Threat Detection
In this paper, we present a DirichletMarked Hawkes Process (DMHP) to detect malicious activities frominsiders in real-time. DMHP combines the Dirichlet process andmarked Hawkes processes to model the sequence of user activities.


## Running Environment

```
Python 3.7.3
```

## DateSet

We evaluate **DMHP** on two kinds of datasets: [CERT Insider Threat Dataset](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=508099) and Wikipidia dataset.

## Model Evaluation

Run the model on the *Insider Threat Dataset* by the following command

```
    python DMHP.py
```
